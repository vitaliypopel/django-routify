# Django-Routify
**Django-Routify** is a package for simple routing Views in the classic Django framework.

With Django-Routify package you no longer have to manually register your views in `urlpatterns` using django.urls.path function.

Django-Routify can help you to easily register your views using Router class and his @Router.route(...) decorator.
If you are familiar with Flask, FastAPI or even Django REST Framework, you know that every single view should be registered using decorators.
It is <ins>easy to read</ins> first of all, and <ins>simplified work</ins>.

Also you can set `auto_trailing_slash` to `True` value when you're initializing your Router and can write your url_path similar to Flask, FastAPI etc.
If `auto_trailing_slash` is `True` then url_path which will be equal to `'/hello-world'` will be translated to classic Django url rule - `'hello-world/'`.

Django-Routify is support `function` and `class` based views, and also `asynchronous`.

### Using Django-Routify with Django

~/project/app/views.py:
```python
from django.http import HttpRequest, HttpResponse

from django_routify import Router

router = Router('/app', 'app', auto_trailing_slash=True)
# or   = Router(prefix='/app', app_name='app', auto_trailing_slash=True)


@router.route('/hello-world', methods=['GET'])
def hello_world(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')
```

~/project/app/urls.py:
```python
from django_routify import include_router

from .views import router

urlpatterns = [
    include_router(router),
]
```

### Using classic Django

~/project/app/views.py:
```python
from django.http import HttpRequest, HttpResponse
from django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods


@require_http_methods(['GET'])
def hello_world(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    return HttpResponse('Hello World!')
```

~/project/app/urls.py:
```python
from django.urls import path, include

from .views import hello_world

app_name = 'app'
urlpatterns = [
    path(
        'app/',
        include([
                path('hello-world/', hello_world, name='hello_world'),
        ])
    ),
]
```
